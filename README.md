This code demonstrates a way to make your app the only instance running on your syatem.

If you run it once the app will start.

If you run it again while the first is still running, any arguments passed to it will be
displayed in the UI of the first instance.

To test it, run it from file explorer, then drag a few other onto the exe.
The path to the files you drag should show on the original UI.
